This is a plugin writen by Karolz,and the before version has  some bugs.
But the unreal eninge 4.7.0, i just have tested ,it is ok,and easy to use.

I think u must love it.It can easy to creat a plugin,without doing too much operator.
There are three different choices for u ,and if you like to show the button or the unreal eidtor u can just use Advanced mode.

It is very useful for the new plugin starter.

Now here is how to use the plugin.
